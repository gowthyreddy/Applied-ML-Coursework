This is the assignmnets I did part of my AML Coursework. The major reason I chose this course by Dr. Zouran Tiganj is because of the quality of assignments. Each Assignment covers various topics, with interesting and easy-hard level tasks on those topics. This improved my fundamentals and made my grip on essential ML methods much stronger. He taught concepts in a very simple yet interesting way to understand the behind-the-scenes of these Methods. This course clears my prerequisite to take advanced AI/ML coursework or dive deeper into specialised ML methods.  Throughout this course, I learned and worked extensively on topics like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Stochiastic Methods, Decision Tree Methods, Artificial Neural Networks, CNN's and NLP.
